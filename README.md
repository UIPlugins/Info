# Rules:

2. Use MIT License for the plugins.
3. Be as obnoxious and ridiculous as possible
4. Submit & get it approved on Poggit
5. Have fun :joy:

# Code Style:
Of course, we have to keep things clean so that it doesn't look like turd for other developers.

As for code style, we should use PSR-2 coding standards, or something closely identifyable as resembling that.

For examples, Check out: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md

(personally I prefer the opening brackets on the same line, but eh.. ~ cortex)
